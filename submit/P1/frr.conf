# - BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

# Used between different networks (autonomous systems), e.g. between ISPs.

# The protocol of the Internet — it decides how packets move across the globe.

# Policy-driven: you can choose paths based on rules, not just shortest routes.

# Example: ISP use BGP to exchange routes with other ISPs.

# - OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

# An interior gateway protocol (IGP) — used inside one organization’s network.

# Builds a map of the network using link-state advertisements.

# Chooses routes based on the shortest path (Dijkstra’s algorithm).

# Fast convergence (reacts quickly to changes).

# Example: Used within a data center or company’s internal network.

# - IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System)

# Another IGP, similar to OSPF, also link-state based.

# Scales very well in large provider networks.

# Originally designed for OSI networks, but adapted for IP.

# Heavily used by ISPs and telecom operators.
